If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you
characterize their audio aura?
Based on the average energy (0.65906), valence (0.484443), and danceability (0.71646),
I would characterize the listeners aura as euphoric, dreamy, and fun. This might align well with
spotifies pink and orange auras.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative
of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

This may not be representative because taking an average results in the 'extremes' being cancelled out.
For example, maybe a listener listened to slow, mellow songs half the time, and fast, upbeat songs
the other hald of the time. You could easily assign two separate moods to them if you were to split
the data in half and take the average of each half, for example. Or you could take the mode of
each category. But when you take the average of the categories, you are getting values that are somewhere
in the middle of what they were listening to, which may not be a good representation if they were listening
to the extremes.
