Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations France had an increased probability of winning (6-10%), however, with more simulations, that probability dropped to 3.4%.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would call 10000 simulations enough. This number seemed to return good predictions, and more simulations dramatically increased the speed of the program.
